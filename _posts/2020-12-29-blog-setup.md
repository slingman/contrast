Let's see what this thing can do, I am gonna have to learn markdown now :-)

Setting this blog up has been an interesting couple of days.  Since my portfolio site has been set up on https://slingman.github.io, I wanted to add another path below that /blog.  The reason for this set up is because I want to try to do a **Project 365** again for 2021.  
I did one back in 2013 but stopped short towards the end of March.  That is some hard stuff to do, but I think i am up for the challenge again with this new blog set up!
